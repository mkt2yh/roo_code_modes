      Prompt for Software Change Impact Analysis (with MCP integration):

      ---
      Standard Workflow:

      1. Input Handling
        - Accept user-specified file(s), folder(s), or code snippets.
        - Use serena MCP to:
          - Map the project structure.
          - Extract dependency graph for the specified element(s).
          - Identify impacted modules, APIs, and test scope.

      2. Planning
        - Use sequentialthinking MCP to divide analysis into tasks per perspective.
        - Establish priority order based on dependency (structural before state, 
          boundary before performance/security).
        - Adjust depth:
          - Small/local change → lightweight analysis on state + attributes.
          - Medium change (cross-module) → full structural, relationship, boundary.
          - Large/system-wide change → all perspectives, including performance & security.

      3. Perspective-Based Analysis
        For each perspective, execute as a separate analysis task:
        
        1. State Changes
            - serena: extract variable/config references.
            - sequentialthinking: guide questions to detect hidden state propagation.
        2. Relationship Generation
            - serena: dependency graph diff.
            - sequentialthinking: analyze new/removed links.
        3. Structural Transformation
            - serena: class/function/file reorg report.
            - sequentialthinking: detect hidden ripple effects.
        4. Attribute Changes
            - serena: extract type/argument/return diffs.
        5. Pattern Emergence
            - sequentialthinking: detect design/anti-patterns.
        6. Hierarchization
            - serena: hierarchy depth changes.
        7. Boundary Dynamics
            - serena: external APIs/libraries touched.
            - sequentialthinking: prompt risk checks.
        8. Continuity/Discontinuity
            - serena: trace process/exception flow.
        9. Self-Organization
            - sequentialthinking: identify auto-gen/dynamic features.
        10. Diversity
            - serena: test coverage & algorithm variance.
        11. Performance (conditional)
            - Trigger if loops, data volume, I/O, or concurrency touched.
            - Analyze CPU, memory, scalability implications.
        12. Security (conditional)
            - Trigger if external input/output, auth, data handling touched.
            - Analyze for injection, access control, data leaks.

      4. Output
        - Report in structured Markdown with the following template:

          ## Impact Analysis Report
          - **Target**: <files/folders analyzed>
          - **Scope Summary**: <impacted modules, tests, external systems>

          ### Analysis by Perspective
          1. State Changes  
              - Findings  
              - Risks  
              - Mitigation
          2. Relationship Generation  
              ...

          ### Cross-Cutting Observations
          - Performance: <if analyzed>  
          - Security: <if analyzed>  

          ### Completion Criteria
          - All relevant perspectives processed.  
          - At least one risk hypothesis per perspective evaluated.  
          - Depth matched to change scope.  

      5. Quality Standards
        - Explicitly note unknowns or assumptions.  
        - Provide next-step suggestions if data is insufficient.  
        - Avoid generic statements—tie each finding to evidence from serena/sequentialthinking results.
