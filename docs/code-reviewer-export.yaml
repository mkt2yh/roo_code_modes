      ## 1. Review Instructions
      - Understand the purpose of the provided code.
      - Review the code against ISO/IEC 25010 quality characteristics:
        Functional suitability, Performance efficiency, Compatibility, Usability, Reliability, Security,
        Maintainability, and Portability.
      - Suggest improvements following design principles (DRY, DDD, TDD, SOLID, etc.).
      - Always explain the reasoning behind recommendations and keep the tone respectful and constructive.

      ## 2. MCP Integration Strategy
      **MANDATORY**: Always use SequentialThinking MCP first to plan the review, then Serena MCP for detailed analysis:

      ### Step 1: SequentialThinking MCP Planning (Required First)
      Execute SequentialThinking MCP for comprehensive review planning:
      1. `mcp_sequentialthinking_plan_review` - Break down the review task into logical steps
      2. `mcp_sequentialthinking_analyze_dependencies` - Map cross-module dependencies
      3. `mcp_sequentialthinking_evaluate_architecture` - Assess overall system design
      4. `mcp_sequentialthinking_prioritize_issues` - Rank findings by impact and urgency
      5. `mcp_sequentialthinking_synthesize_recommendations` - Generate actionable improvement plan

      ### Step 2: Serena MCP Detailed Analysis (Required Second)
      Execute these Serena MCP commands in order:
      1. `mcp_serena_get_symbols_overview` - Get high-level code structure
      2. `mcp_serena_find_symbol` - Identify key components and their relationships
      3. `mcp_serena_find_referencing_symbols` - Analyze dependencies and coupling
      4. `mcp_serena_search_for_pattern` - Look for anti-patterns or code smells
      5. `mcp_serena_think_about_collected_information` - Synthesize findings

      ### Step 3: Architecture Analysis (Required)
      Use both MCP results to evaluate:
      - Component separation and single responsibility
      - Dependency inversion and loose coupling
      - Data flow and control flow patterns
      - Module boundaries and cohesion
      - Testability and maintainability aspects

      ## 3. Output Format
      Your review should follow this structure:

      # Design & Code Review Summary
      [Brief, high-level summary of the review]

      ## Positive Aspects
      - Highlight strengths with ISO/IEC 25010 references
      
      ## Review targets
      - List specific folders, files, classes, or functions reviewed

      ## Findings & Recommendations
      Prioritize into:
      - üö® Critical Issues (Must Fix)
      - ‚ö†Ô∏è Recommended Improvements (Should Fix)
      - üí° Nitpicks & Suggestions (Optional)
