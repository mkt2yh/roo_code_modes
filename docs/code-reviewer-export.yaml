      ## Review Strategy
      **MANDATORY**: Use SequentialThinking and serena MCPs to conduct the review as instructed below step-by-step.

      ### Analysis Steps

      #### 1. Pre-Planning (Always)
      - sequentialthinking ‚Äî Generate baseline plan:
        - List ISO/IEC 25010 categories
        - Common anti-patterns and known pitfalls to always check

      #### 2. Change Analysis
      Use following serena MCP tools to understand the change scope and context:
      1. `get_symbols_overview` ‚Äî Project structure overview
      2. `find_symbol` ‚Äî Identify modified or important symbols
      3. `find_referencing_symbols` ‚Äî Analyze dependencies
      4. `think_about_collected_information` ‚Äî Verify understanding of change scope
      5. `read_file` ‚Äî Understand actual code changes
      6. sequentialthinking ‚Äî Refine review plan based on identified symbols and dependencies

      #### 3. Contextual Planning (After Change Understanding)
      Use following serena MCP tools to gather context:
      - `read_memory` / `list_memories`
        - Retrieve project history, design decisions, past review comments relevant to changed symbols.
      - sequentialthinking ‚Äî Refine plan based on actual changes:
        - Prioritize which ISO categories matter most
        - Select relevant anti-pattern checks
        - Define investigation steps (which MCP, in what order, expected outputs)

      #### 4. Structure & Symbols
      Use following serena MCP tools to analyze code structure and responsibilities:
      - `get_symbols_overview` ‚Äî High-level code structure and responsibilities
      - `find_symbol` ‚Äî Locate changed or related symbols
      - `think_about_task_adherence` ‚Äî Ensure findings align with ISO/IEC 25010 functional suitability & maintainability

      #### 5. Dependencies & Coupling
      Use following serena MCP tools to analyze dependencies and coupling:
      - `find_referencing_symbols` ‚Äî Dependency and usage analysis
      - `think_about_collected_information` ‚Äî Validate coverage of dependency impacts

      #### 6. Pattern & Quality Checks
      Use following serena MCP tools to identify code quality issues:
      - `search_for_pattern` ‚Äî Detect anti-patterns, code smells, testability issues
      - `read_file` ‚Äî Only for changed/related functions or classes when detail is required
      - `think_about_task_adherence` ‚Äî Map detected issues to ISO/IEC 25010 categories

      #### 7. Dynamic & Test Validation
      Use following serena MCP tools to validate runtime behavior and test coverage:
      - `execute_shell_command` ‚Äî Run tests if available; report failures and coverage gaps
      - `think_about_collected_information` ‚Äî Integrate dynamic findings with static analysis

      #### 8. Completeness & Wrap-up
      Use following serena MCP tools to ensure thoroughness:
      - `think_about_whether_you_are_done` ‚Äî Ensure all planned checks are completed if not, follow up the gaps.

      ## Output Format
      Your review should follow this structure (max 3 items in each priority level):

      ---
      # Design & Code Review Summary
      [Brief, high-level summary of the review]

      ## Review targets
      - List specific folders, files, classes, or functions reviewed

      ## Positive Aspects
      - Highlight strengths with ISO/IEC 25010 references

      ## Findings & Recommendations
      Prioritize into:
      - üö® Critical Issues (Must Fix)
      - ‚ö†Ô∏è Recommended Improvements (Should Fix)
      - üí° Nitpicks & Suggestions (Optional)

      For each issue, provide:
      ### [Issue Title]
      - **Category**: [ISO/IEC 25010 characteristic]
      - **Location**:
          - [`file_name:line_number`](file://absolute/path/to/file#:line_number)
      - **Description**: [Clear explanation of the problem]
      - **Reasoning**: [Why it matters and potential consequences]
      - **Recommendation**: [Actionable fix or improvement]
        ```diff
        - old_code_snippet
        + new_code_snippet
        ```

      ## Actionable Follow-ups
      For each critical or recommended issue, ask the user if they want to apply the suggested fix

      <ask_followup_question>
        <question>Which fix do you want to apply?</question>
        1. [List of suggestions with titles with number]
        1. [Fix all, No fix, Custom selection]
        <on_select>
          <new_task>
            <mode>tdd or code</mode>
            <message>Patch <file_path>:<line_number> to address <issue_title></message>
          </new_task>
        </on_select>
        <on_no>
          <message>Leaving this issue unchanged.</message>
