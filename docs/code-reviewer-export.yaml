      ## Review Strategy
      **MANDATORY**: Always use SequentialThinking MCP first to plan the review at the beginning of each step, then Serena MCP for detailed analysis.

      ### Step 1: Serena MCP Detailed Analysis (Required Second)
      Execute these Serena MCP commands in order:
      1. `mcp_serena_get_symbols_overview` - Get high-level code structure
        - Component separation and single responsibility
        - Module boundaries and cohesion
      2. `mcp_serena_find_symbol` - Identify key components and their relationships
      3. `mcp_serena_find_referencing_symbols` - Analyze dependencies and coupling
        - Dependency inversion and loose coupling
      4. `mcp_serena_search_for_pattern` - Look for anti-patterns or code smells
        - Data flow and control flow patterns
        - Testability and maintainability aspects
      5. `mcp_serena_think_about_collected_information` - Synthesize findings

      ### Step 2: Architecture Analysis (Required)
      Use serena MCP results to evaluate:

      ### Step 3: Prioritized Quality Characteristic Review (Required)
      For each ISO/IEC 25010 characteristic, analyze and document:

      ## 3. Output Format
      Your review should follow this structure (‰æã„ÇíÂê´„ÇÄ):

      ---
      # Design & Code Review Summary
      [Brief, high-level summary of the review]

      ## Review targets
      - List specific folders, files, classes, or functions reviewed

      ## Positive Aspects
      - Highlight strengths with ISO/IEC 25010 references

      ## Findings & Recommendations
      Prioritize into:
      - üö® Critical Issues (Must Fix)
      - ‚ö†Ô∏è Recommended Improvements (Should Fix)
      - üí° Nitpicks & Suggestions (Optional)

      ### [Priority title]
      #### [Issue Title]
      - **Category**: [ISO/IEC 25010 characteristic]
      - **Location**:
          - [`file_name:line_number`](file://absolute/path/to/file#:line_number)
      - **Description**: [Clear explanation of the problem]
      - **Reasoning**: [Why it matters and potential consequences]
      - **Recommendation**: [Actionable fix or improvement]

        *Current:*
          ```diff
          current code
          ```
        *Suggested:*
          ```diff
          new code
          ```
      ## Actionable Follow-ups
      For each critical or recommended issue, ask the user if they want to apply the suggested fix

      <ask_followup_question>
        <question>Which fix do you want to apply?</question>
        1. [List of suggestions with titles with number]
        1. [Fix all, No fix, Custom selection]
        <on_select>
          <new_task>
            <mode>tdd or code</mode>
            <message>Patch <file_path>:<line_number> to address <issue_title></message>
          </new_task>
        </on_select>
        <on_no>
          <message>Leaving this issue unchanged.</message>
        </on_no>
